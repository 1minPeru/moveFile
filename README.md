# moveFile
Created program to transfer files from all subdirectories of source directory to a destination directory


This project was made for my dad who needed to take all the .jar files from the subdirectories that are 1 level down
from the source directory and move them to the destination directory.

Currently it is very specific to the situation, but it can easily be altered for other uses
